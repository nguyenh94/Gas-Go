# Gas-Go
Out of the many essentials we have to pay for, money spent on gas might be the hardest to keep track of due to the always changing prices. Gas$Go is an iOS application in Swift designed for users to keep track of their gas receipts as well as the date and location for each gas fill up. The app also supports Vietnamese alongside English. Once logged in, you can keep track of your profile, store your car model, and your gas receipts. Utilizing TableView, delegates and datasource, UIImage picker, localization and internalization, segues, and other techniques. To authorize users for registration and login, I used Firebase Authentication. I also use Firestore and Firebase Storage to store the usersâ€™ profile pictures and receipts they entered.
